Moonjelly DAO Gitcoin Grant Call Climate Change December 2021


Grant Description: 

Who are We?

Moonjelly DAO is decentralizing ocean conservation: building a new financial impact model where the world profits from restoring the wild living ocean. We understand that no approach to halting climate change can succeed without the ocean:  Ocean action is Climate Action. 

What is a Moonjelly? 

The jellyfish Aurelia Aurita is the world’s only biologically immortal creature: These animals hang out in oceans around the world and can turn back time by reverting to an earlier stage of their life cycle. We believe in the restorative super powers of nature and we’re here to allow this process to take place for the oceans. 

How it Works: 

Our mission is to steward a system that rewards ocean impact, socially and economically, building a worldwide community of ocean impact doers across our impact verticals selected by top ocean scientists: Climate change, Habitat destruction, Biodiversity loss, Industrial waste water and agriculture pollution, Unsustainable fisheries, Illegal wildlife trade, Plastic Pollution, Shipping & Posidonia. 

To achieve this Moonjelly DAO has based our technical approach on three pillars:sustainable treasury, maintaining verified impact creation, and providing funding to projects generating the biggest impact for the ocean. 

Our current iteration is a Grants DAO- projects apply for funding from the DAO, expert committees vet projects for feasibility, our community votes on which  projects to receive funding and projects undergo full verification.  But we are not stopping there. Keep an eye out for our whitepaper launch in January 2022 for a deeper dive into the innovative tokenomics of profitable impact. 


The Ocean and Climate: 
“The ocean plays a critical role in the global climate system. Not only does the ocean take in an estimated 93% of the heat trapped by rising GHG levels, it also absorbs approximately 25-30% of anthropogenic CO2 emissions while producing about half of the earth’s oxygen through the photosynthetic activity of marine plants and algae. The risks to our ocean and coastlines from climate change are well publicised, including potentially catastrophic sea-level rise impacting many millions of people around the world, continued acidification decimating marine life, and disruption of the ocean’s temperature gradient and typical flow patterns that could have enormous world-wide impacts on weather systems.
The potential of the ocean for accelerating decarbonisation, however, merits increased priority in the global climate-change discourse. The High-Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy (HLP), a multilateral group comprising representatives from 14 oceanic countries, estimates that by 2050 ocean-based climate mitigation and carbon storage options from healthy marine ecosystems could make up 21% of the emissions reductions needed to limit global warming to 1.5°C.7 Put differently, this equates to more than all current global emissions from coal-fired power plants worldwide” - Economist Impact (https://ocean.economist.com/innovation/articles/checking-in-on-ocean-basedclimate-solutions)
